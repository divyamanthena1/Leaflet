This project analyzes earthquake data from United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 

The data plotted on the map gives information on earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. The markers display more specific information on the earthquakes related to their magnitude, depth, and location and earthquakes with higher magnitude appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker. Both HTML and Javascript were utilized to create the webpage and plot the data.
